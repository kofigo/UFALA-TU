# Mapping Forest Fires in Mount Kenya

The highest mountain in Kenya - and the second highest on the African continent - Mount Kenya is enclosed within the Mount Kenya National Park which covers an area of 715 km2 in the central highlands of the country. The National Park and Forest Reserve were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 and are a key driver of both local and international tourism to Kenya.

# Monitoring Chlorophyll in Lake Elmenteita, Kenya
Around 120km North of Nairobi, nestled on the floor of Kenya’s Great Rift Valley lies Lake Elmenteita. Named from the Maasai word ‘ol muteita’ meaning place of dust, the alkaline lake is a lifeline for thriving populations of birds and wildlife, including Rothschilds giraffes, pelicans, colobus monkeys and flamingos. Over 450 species of bird call the lake home, and the ecological significance of the area was recognised in 2005, when Elmenteita was recognised as a Wetland of International Importance.
